# Physics-local-Chatbot
A local physics chatbot that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. Upload your physics textbooks and ask questions - the system works completely offline. It processes PDFs to create a knowledge base and provides detailed physics explanations, making learning accessible without internet dependency.
# Features
Local Execution: Fully functional offline, ensuring privacy
RAG Architecture: Combines the power of retrieval systems and generative language models for accurate and relevant answers.
Multi-session Support: Enables smooth conversations over multiple interactions.
Open Source Models: Uses the Llama3:latest model from Ollama for efficient and lightweight performance.
Factual and Conversational: Capable of answering questions and holding conversations effectively.(it may hallucinate when hold conversation )
GPU Acceleration: Utilizes GPU for faster processing when available
Performance Metrics: Monitor response quality, timing, and physics-specific metrics

# Weaknesses
Slow Response Time: The chatbot may take a significant amount of time to generate responses.
Potential for Hallucinations: While holding conversations, the model may occasionally generate inaccurate or fabricated information.
